# 💫 About Me:
🚀 I’m currently working on:<br>Developing cutting-edge deep learning models, including LLMs and computer vision systems. On the side, I'm building full-stack applications using modern frameworks like Next.js, Vue.js, and robust backends powered by Node.js, Spring Boot, and GraphQL.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:<br>Exciting ML projects and deep learning innovations. If it involves neural networks or pushing the boundaries of AI, count me in!<br><br>🧠 I’m looking for help with:<br>Decoding the complexities of deep learning models and optimizing machine learning pipelines. If you have wizardry in model fine-tuning, let’s connect!<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning:<br>The fascinating world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced deep learning techniques for computer vision.<br><br>💬 Ask me about:<br>Backend development, the latest frameworks on the block, and why modern tech stacks are so exciting. I love geeking out about them!<br><br>⚡ Fun fact:<br>I once coded for 15 hours straight without taking a break—powered purely by caffeine and determination. 🚀
